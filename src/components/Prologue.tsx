                    Thank you for visiting my portfolio. A brief intro about me, 
                    I am a full stack developer that focuses on ASP.NET
                    and React / Typescript - but I will expand more on that in the 
                    following chapters. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This portfolio is meant to be navigated like a book 
                    and this page serves as the prologue, and each 
                    chapter will expand  according to its title. However 
                    youâ€™ll quickly find out that contents within each chapter 
                    are not laid-out like a traditional book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That being said, feel free to skip ahead, each chapter are
                    independent of each other, so click any of the links in the side bar or nav-bar.
                </p>
                <p>I don't want to babble too much, so enjoy.</p>
